    <h4 style="color: #457b9dff; font-size: 24px; text-shadow: 2px 2px #f1faeeff;" >As you know I am not the best at deciding what to get people for gifts, one of the things
that you did not pass along to me. I am very grateful for what you have passed down to me though. I see you in myself everyday: your passion, work ethic, and care for others to see them do their best. I think that I’ve gotten these things not just because you are my mom but because of how dedicated you were to raising not just me but me and Gabi. Ever since I could step onto a baseball field, I’ve always wanted to be just like you and you’ve been my role model for my entire life. I know you may think that you did not do a perfect job, but I’ve always wanted to tell you that I would not have wanted to be raised by anybody else in any other situation.. You and dad have taught me to have drive in anything I do, but the drive I carry everyday is the drive to be successful in the hopes that one day I can pay you back for everything that you have done for me. I know I can be a stubborn kid and not want to do all the things that you tell me, but I am starting to realize that our time spent together is some of the most important time that I can spend in my day. I look forward to many more Walking Dead date nights and I hope that I can make you proud of the son that you’ve watched grow up. Thank you momma and I love you forever. </h4>
